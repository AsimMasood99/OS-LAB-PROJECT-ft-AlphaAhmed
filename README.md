## Getting Started
(Bhai, Linux par hi kaam karna :) )

1. Create a new folder.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Run the following commands:
   - `git init`
   - `git remote set-url origin repoKaLink`
   - `git pull origin master`
4. Bas, is ke baad kaam start karo.
5. To push your changes use
      `git push origin master`
## How to Compile and Run the Code

To compile the code first cd to the directory that contains the file that needs compiling and then run the following command:

```bash
gcc file.c -o file.elf
```

Here, `.elf` is the extension for executables in Linux. **Please don't do this**:

```bash
gcc file.c -o file
```

This creates an extensionless executable, which, while it works, can get uploaded to GitHub because `.gitignore` might not detect it for some reason. 

Use the command above to compile the code and then run it using the next command:

```bash
./file.elf
```

This will execute your file.

We don't have to do anything else to run the code. The code will just work with these two commands.

## Note
**AGER FOR SOME REASONG GITHUB NA CONNECT HO RAHI HO AP KA PAS VSCODE MAIN (becasue linux is a shit os and it may try to present you with its sister in the proccess) THEN CONTACT ME AND WE WILL TRY TO CONNECT YOU TO THE REPO WITHOUT DESTORYING THE GITHUB REPO.**

**ALSO IF IT YOU GET CONNECETED AND YOU ARE GETTING ERROR WHILE PULLING OR PUSHING. DONT TRY TO PUSH THE LIMITS. I AM SAYING THIS WITH EXPERIENCE.**
